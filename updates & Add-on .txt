  4. Storage
    - Two Buckets : blogs & profile

-- Important consideration -- 

    - Email Verification [ supabase] : OFF 
    - Realtime : OFF
    - Email Validation : OFF

-- Check List --
  - Docs for the Entire website  [ Do it at the End ]
  - Add Full Name field in sign up page.
  - Instead of keeping the default user profile picture for all, we can allow users to choose from pre-uploaded options, and permit team members and admins to upload their own. 
  - Model for Members [ Details for each members should be shown. ] - frontend .
  - 404 Page Not Found - Page Needed to be Styled.

  - Update in Policies for blogs table : Rather than this "Admin/team can create/update/delete blogs" -> "Admin/team can create blogs" , "( writer_id (team member) ) writer can only update/delete his own blogs" ,"Admin can delete blogs".
  - Admin Panel for Team Management :
    - Admin can change role of members & their domain.
    - Admin can decide the role of user in users table ( team , user )
  - A live route to display the current upcoming event.
  - Design and implement email templates and redirect URLs in supabase.
  - Specific Team Member Information Popup : Implement a screen to display detailed information about a specific team member.

  - User Event Page Development - Management 
    - User Process Management
      - Users will have a process status:
          - Ongoing
          - Completed
        [ Team and admin can change the process status via a toggle button. ]
    - Database Modifications:
      - Add a Process Column [ Introduce a new column in the registrations table to store the process status. ]
    - Policy Updates:
      - Create policies that allow team and admin to update the registrations table.
    - Event Selection: 
      - Implement a dropdown to select events.
      - Based on selected event show all the users register in that event.
    - Event Status Logic:
      - Determine event status based on time:
        - If event_time + 12 hours > current_time, then the event is ongoing.
        - Otherwise, the event is completed.
      - If an event is completed, the team cannot update the user process [ Implement the  logic in the frontend to ensure proper user experience ]
